Front End Nanodegree: Arcade Game

Welcome to my Project 3 for Udacity Front End Nanodegree!

Please use the arrow keys to move the player around. Try to avoid
enemy bugs and cars. Reach the top of the screen to increase the score.
If you collide with a car or bug, the game will reset.

Use the select menu at the bottom to change character sprite at any time.

** NOTE: If you do make a selection for the sprite, click on the game screen
again to continue playing!!

** NOTE #2: helper.js is a file I created for other functions and variables
that are used in the program.
