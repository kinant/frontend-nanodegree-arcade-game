Front End Nanodegree: Arcade Game

Welcome to my Project 3 for Udacity Front End Nanodegree!

HOW TO RUN:

- Game will immediately run

HOW TO PLAY:
- Please use the arrow keys to move the player around. Try to avoid
enemy bugs and cars.

- Reach the top of the screen to increase the score.
If you collide with a car or bug, the game will reset.

- Use the select menu at the bottom to change character sprite at any time.
If you do make a selection for the sprite and your player does not move,
click on the game screen again to continue playing!
